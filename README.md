This repo developes multiple machine learning models for the Higgs Bosom experiments at the CERN.
The methods are:
- Least Squares with Gradient Descent
- Least Squares with Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Least Squares
- Ridge Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Regularized Logistic Regression

Each of these methods is implemented in a different python file. Our best results is obtained by running: run.py

Furthermore, the script implementations.py is a script done for the user to test any model, and decide which model to pick, with/without polynomial augmentation and with the degree of the augmentation.

The data for training and testing should be put in the "data" folder, and the results are saved in the script folder.
